# T9 Algorithm

Implementation of the classic T9 algorithm with an interactive visual keyboard for input

## How to use

Your keyboard consists of keys 1-9 and the # key. Keys 2-9 are mapped to letters, with key 2 representing 'abc', key 3 for 'def', and so on. Key 1 functions as the backspace, while the # key is used to switch between words.
